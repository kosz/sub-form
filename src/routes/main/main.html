    <h2>Hello, world!</h2>
    <p>Your web app and dev env have been scaffolded with generator-modular and yeoman, and preconfigured with various development tools.</p>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">generator-modular is a work in progress in it's early stages. Please read <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kosz/generator-modular">this</a> for more information. Run gulp ngdocs to generate documentation pages for your app</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">You can start development now by running <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kosz/generator-modular">subgenerators</a> to generate controllers, services, directives, routes, etc.</p>
